/*
	In Go, when you pass a struct to a function, a copy of the struct is made unless you explicitly pass it as a POINTER.
	When you pass a struct that contains a pointer to another object (in this case, a MongoDB client),
	you are still passing a copy of the struct, but since the pointer inside the struct points to the same underlying object, modifications to the object are visible to all references.

	When you pass *structs.MongoClient to functions like addBooking, getAllBookings, and getBookingById, you are passing the actual client and not the address of the client (&variable).
	The * in this context is used to dereference the pointer inside the MongoClient struct, giving you the actual mongo.Client object.
